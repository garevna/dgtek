Melbourne alternative ϐibre operator DGtek is deploying its network in the city’s central business district in a direct challenge to NBN, Telstra and other major telcos.
CommsDay has learned that DGtek has expanded its network footprint from Port Melbourne to Moorabbin, branching to the CBD, South Melbourne, St Kilda, Elwood and Bentleigh.
Early 2020 will see DGtek’s footprint further expanded throughout the residential areas of Elwood, Bentleigh and Moorabbin with plans to extend further to Clayton and Oakleigh.
DGtek was successful in raising new equity from Treia Capital, an Australian based value-add infrastructure investor, in July this year.

If you’ve followed along with the leaks in recent weeks, none of the new features will surprise you.
It’s also not a huge surprise that Google is bringing some features from Inbox over to Gmail.
What did surprise me while trying out the new service ahead of today’s launch, though, is that some features that didn’t get a lot of attention in the leaks, including the new consistent sidebar with its built-in Google Calendar, Tasks and Keep integration, are maybe among the most useful of the additions here.
