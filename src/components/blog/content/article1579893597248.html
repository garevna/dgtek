<p>Melbourne alternative fibre operator DGtek is deploying its network in the city’s central business district in a direct challenge to NBN, Telstra and other major telcos.</p>
<p>CommsDay has learned that DGtek has expanded its network footprint from Port Melbourne to Moorabbin, branching to the CBD, South Melbourne, St Kilda, Elwood and Bentleigh.</p>
<p>Early 2020 will see DGtek’s footprint further expanded throughout the residential areas of Elwood, Bentleigh and Moorabbin with plans to extend further to Clayton and Oakleigh.</p>
<p>DGtek was successful in raising new equity from Treia Capital, an Australian based value-add infrastructure investor, in July this year.</p>
<p>If you’ve followed along with the leaks in recent weeks, none of the new features will surprise you.</p>
<p>It’s also not a huge surprise that Google is bringing some features from Inbox over to Gmail.</p>
<p>What did surprise me while trying out the new service ahead of today’s launch, though, is that some features that didn’t get a lot of attention in the leaks,
  including the new consistent sidebar with its built-in Google Calendar, Tasks and Keep integration, are maybe among the most useful of the additions here.</p>
